# Overview

This project is intended to create and simulate a Jewelry Inventory. This is written in TypeScript because I would like to escalate the code and integrate it for an e-commerce.Typescript helps escalability by avoiding type issues resulting in user satisfaction. 

The Jewelry inventory software stores information about multiple jewerly and prices. We can retrieve the information and add more jewels as needed. The software also calculate the IGV, a particular tax for sells in Peru, and adds the taxes to show the final price for each jewel.

I have written this software because I would like to eventually create an Jewelry E-commerce and use the logic of this program to manage the Jewelry inventory.
